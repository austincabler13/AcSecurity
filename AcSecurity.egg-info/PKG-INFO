## ðInstallation

You can install AcSecurity using `pip`. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install AcSecurity
```

Ensure you have Python 3.12.0 and `pip` installed on your machine.

## ð¨Usage

After installing the module, you can use it to scan your application directory for vulnerabilities. Hereâs how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the scanner using the command below, replacing `/path/to/your/application` with the path to your application directory:

   ```bash
   acsecurity /path/to/your/application
   ```

3. The scanner will output any vulnerabilities found in your application.

### ðExample

```bash
acsecurity /home/user/my_project
```

## ðVersion View and Help View

You can check the version and access help information using the following commands:

```bash
acsecurity --version
acsecurity --help
```

## ðFeatures

- **Common Vulnerability Checks:** Scans for hardcoded secrets such as passwords or API keys in your code.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Checks:** Uses `pip-audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in your installed Python packages.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Uses `pylint` to identify code quality issues and ensure your code adheres to best practices.
- **Output:** All findings are written to `issues.txt` in the current directory.
- **Version Info:** Use `--version` to view the version you have.
- **Help Info:** Use `--help` to get assistance and see what you can do.
